# Banking and Shopping System  

## 📌 Overview
This mini project implements a Banking System integrated with a Shopping Cart System using Object-Oriented Programming in C++.  

The user can:  
- *Create a bank account*  
- *Deposit & withdraw money*   
- *Check balance*   
- *Add items to a shopping cart*
- *Delete or modify cart items*
- *Perform billing after verifying password*
- *Automatically deduct the shopping amount from the bank account*  

This project demonstrates the use of:
- Classes & Objects
- Structures
- Friend Functions
- Encapsulation
- Modular Programming
